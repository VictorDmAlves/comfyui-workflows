A breathtaking night scene captures the mesmerizing aurora borealis dancing above a snow-capped mountain range. The vibrant green and purple lights create stunning vertical curtains across the dark sky, reflecting beautifully in the calm waters of a lake below. Silhouetted evergreen trees frame the landscape on both sides, their shadows stretching into the snowy terrain that surrounds the tranquil body of water. In the foreground, rocks rest peacefully at the edge of the pond where the glow is mirrored with clarity.
