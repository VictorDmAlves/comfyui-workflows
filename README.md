# ComfyUI Workflows
**My personal Workflows.**

This is simply a repository I decided to create to keep a copy of my ComfyUI Workflows, which I've been using for over two years. Furthermore, since I've learned so much from the community on Discord and Reddit, I'm happy to share it with everyone.

Feel free to use them and make your own customizations. Note that I am using GGUF models on my computer; change its nodes if you are using native models.

If you find something that could be improved and you'd like to share it with me, let me know here or through my Reddit username VictorDmAlves.

If you like to keep track of any changes that I make to the Workflows, be sure to Watch this repository on GitHub.

## First of all
I highly recommend using Straight lines in the "Lite Graph" settings, under the "Graph" section. Either this, or keep the lines invisible. My Workflows were built with this in mind.
